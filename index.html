        <p>  <span class="highlight"> Cook </span> the Ground Beef: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until it's browned and cooked through, breaking it apart with a spatula as it cooks. Drain any excess fat. Add Taco Seasoning: Add the taco seasoning mix and water to the cooked beef. Follow the instructions on the seasoning packet or use your own mix of chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Stir well to coat the beef with the seasoning. Let it simmer for a few minutes until the flavors meld together. Prepare Toppings:
While the beef is simmering, prepare your desired toppings. Shred lettuce, dice tomatoes, grate cheese, and prepare any other toppings you like. <span class=highlight> Warm the Taco Shells: If using hard taco shells, you can warm them up by placing them in a preheated oven for a few minutes according to the package instructions. If using soft tortillas, you can warm them in a dry skillet or microwave them for a short time. </span>  Assemble the Tacos: Take a warmed taco shell or tortilla and spoon the seasoned beef into the center. Add your chosen toppings on top of the beef. Serve and Enjoy</p>
